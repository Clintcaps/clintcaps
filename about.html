	 	<div class="title6">
				<h1>I. Summary of the stream</h1>
			</div>

	 	<div class="summary">
	 		<p>We choose to play Hollow knight because it’s much more chilling to play and relaxing to watch. Since hollow knight is an adventure through a vast ruined kingdom of insects and heroes. Explore twisting caverns, battle tainted creatures and befriend bizarre bugs, all in a classic, hand-drawn 2D style. As I play the game I keep talking to the viewers so that they have someone to talk with instead of just playing the game and staying silent. We want our viewers to enjoy the stream by talking to them and reading the chats. Some viewers enjoyed our stream despite the difficulty with the webcam. It’s better not to force your viewers to like the page let them like it without conscience.</p>

	 	<div class="title7">
				<h1>II. Strengths of our Stream</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="summary1">
			<pre>
	 	<p>
- During our stream, the chat is very noisy and we take this as a strength since it shows
 that our viewers still watching the stream and not just idling in other tabs
- Our chosen platform is easy to access since all we had to do is send the link to potential viewers
- Using Streamlabs makes it easy with the overlay since it’s easy to use and it’s automatic.</p>

	 	  <div class="title9">
				<h1>III. Areas of Opportunities for Our Stream</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="summary2">
				<p>By using social media like Facebook, we will have an opportunity to gain more people to watch our stream, because nowadays people use social media to work in the gaming industry. We need to improve our interaction with the viewers who watched our stream to be more entertaining.</p>

			<div class="summary3">
				<p>The level of engagement in our stream is quite high as some viewers are interacting with the streamer more often. The streamer did his best to interact with them and try to read some comments while playing the game.  It has an effect on our stream, making the viewers stay longer or finish the whole stream because they always get noticed by the streamer.  This is for us to know that the viewers initiated the interactions with the streamers, while sometimes the streamer itself is one who initiates the interaction,  The streamer did his best to interact more often to the viewers making the stream more livier and fun. Taking everything into account, engagement is quite high and important for the better continuation of a channel.</p>

			<div class="title11">
				<h1>V. Analysis of the Viewership of Our Stream</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="summary4">
				<p>The viewership is quite high for us since we are new streamers. In the beginning of the stream the viewers are around 8 then become 14, but at the end it’s like 5 or 6 viewers only, which means that most of the views did not stay longer on our stream and some finished our stream from start to end. Overall since a lot of people use facebook and a lot of streamers use it we have a lot of competitors. The engagement reasons are still applied and reasons why people did not finish or finish it. While the stream collected a total of 16 viewers and 4 viewers remained to stream from start to finish. The total watchtime 150 minutes is important as viewership. 150 minutes divided by 15 on average is a total of 10 minutes of viewership.</p>
